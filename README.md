# EvoLite

An Evolutionary Approach to Neural Network Compression

## Introduction

TODO: Write a proper introduction
EvoLite is a novel evolutionary approach to compressing neural networks. It is based on the idea of evolving a population of neural networks to find the best possible network that can perform the task at hand. EvoLite is designed to be a lightweight and efficient tool for neural network compression. It is written in Python and uses the DEAP library for evolutionary computation.
